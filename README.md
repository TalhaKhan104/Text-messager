# Text-messager
 This project of mine is a text messager using a Twilio API. The Application uses terminal to run the sendsms file in python
 which imports the Twillio rest API and sends a message to a verrified user. The user must be verified with the twillio account
 the credentials of the twillio account must be input as attributes of a 'Client' object which will then be put under the function
 'create'and will send the message to the user designated.
